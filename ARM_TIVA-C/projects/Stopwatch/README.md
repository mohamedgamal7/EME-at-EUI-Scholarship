# 🕒 TIVA C Stopwatch Project 🕒

Welcome to the TIVA C Stopwatch project! 🚀 In this project, we'll be using the TIVA C TM4C123GXL microcontroller to create a fully functional stopwatch. 🎉

## Features 🌟

⏱️ **Accurate Timing:** Utilize the power of TIVA C microcontroller's precise timers and interrupts ⏲️ to achieve accurate timing capabilities.

🔴 **LCD Display:** A clear and easy-to-read LCD display will show the elapsed time, making it convenient to track intervals. 📺

🎛️ **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive buttons will allow you to start ▶️, stop ◼️, and reset 🔄 the stopwatch with ease. Additionally, use a switch to pause ⏸️ and resume ▶️ the timer for greater control.


## Getting Started 🚀

### Materials Needed 🛠️

- TIVA C TM4C123GXL microcontroller
- LCD Display 🖥️
- Pushbuttons 🛈
- Buzzer 🎵 (for audible alerts)
- Jumper wires 🚦
- Breadboard 🍞

### Setup Instructions 🔧

1. Connect the LCD display to the microcontroller following the pinout diagram.
2. Use interrupts for button press detection.
3. Use a switch for pausing ⏸️ and resuming ▶️ the timer.
4. Set up the development environment with TIVA C SDK and Code Composer Studio.
5. Import the project code and flash it onto the microcontroller.
6. Power up the circuit and you're ready to go!


## Usage 🎮

1. Press the 'Start' button ▶️ (switch 2) port to initiate the stopwatch. Interrupts help detect button press quickly.
2. Press 'Stop' ◼️ to pause the timer and 'Start' ▶️ again to resume (all on the same switch (port F).
3. Use the 'Reset' 🔄 button to bring the stopwatch back to zero.
4. Pause ⏸️ the stopwatch with the dedicated switch and continue ▶️ with another press.
